is much arguing about what Drum Corps is, what Drum Corps was, and what it should stand for. I feel we can have some middle ground in these discussions can we not? (My appoligies to the administrators, I only mean for peace and perhaps mutual understanding.)\n\nI have never marched drum corps, I do not play a musical instrument that, as of late (trombone) was ever widely used in Drum Corps (though I do know how to play baritone limitedly). I was an 8th grade marcher and a friend of mine Dylan Liggett introduced me to one video: Bluecoats 2014- Tilt. I had never seen Drum Corps, I had never heard of Drum Corps, and I only had limited knowledge of marching band. Most kids at our highschool do not march until their Freshman year of high school. That one video hooked me on the Marching Arts. After that, I could not watch enough. I became completely engrossed in the marching arts (and I say marching arts because both Drum Corps and Marching Band, as well as all indoor\/WGI ensembles, have their place in advocation and furthuring the marching arts). I took it upon myself to become my own encyclopedia on the topic. By my freshman year, I had taught myself many of the different marching styles (including taraditional, highstep\/chairstep and step over techniques) and through the thanks of sites such as DCX Museum and others, I had found a whole new world of marching arts. \n\nIt was sometime during my Sophomore year in high school that I stumbled across a video, \"Best in the Midwest\", covering the DCI Midwest Championship 1975. I became a fan of Madison Scouts 75' and went even so far as to purchase what DVDs from DCI that I could (75, 79, 88, 11, 14). I have personal plans to buy even more of the DVDs (hopefully all 1980s, and early 2000s). Keep in mind that I am a Senior in high school. \n\nDeep on this page, I saw an argument over the validity of high school marching bands and their sufficiency in \"replacing\" community based Drum Corps. I suppose a large basis on your opinion of this is in the geographic area from which you live. I myself, live in Northern Indiana. Did we at once have a Drum Corps? Yes, Star of Indiana. However, from what I read, Star left Indiana because Disney paid them more money or something like that? Twenty years prior, my own area had the Maple City Cadets. They were decent but never really well known or highly competitive. My state's marching band culture however is entirely different. Many area high schools have had marching bands since the early 1900s and most (if not nearly all) public high schools in Indiana still have some sort of a musical program. During the 60s, Indiana had highly competitive \"Track bands.\" Whoever heard of a track band? I hadnt, and this is my own high school's history (It is really a unique style but thats for anither time). During the 80s and 90s, my state's high schools were doing extremely well in MBOA competitions and our state circuit. At present, Indiana has, perhaps, one of the most competitive state high school band programs where most high school bands compete. Our state, along with Texas and California, as well as others, are growing in competitive high school programs. These programs will never die. At the very least, the benefit is that high school students have exposure to music. \n\nI have seen many points on this page about dislike in the direction of Drum Corps today. Personally, I cannot deny my distaste for the present path of Drum Corps. It is Drum and Bugle corps and, as this unique form of musical art, I feel that it is necessary to maintain rules to keep a distinguishing musical factor between it and marching band. However, I do understand that we do not have any circuit for open community marching bands."}},{"trigger":{"creator":"Timothy","triggerWord":"lit","isPhoto":false,"message":"That's pretty beyotchin man!"}},{"trigger":{"creator":"Ethan","triggerWord":"thank you","isPhoto":false,"message":"Yeahyeahyeahyeahyeahyeahyeahyeahyeahyeahyeahyeahyeahyeahyeahyeahyeahyeahyeahyeahyeahyeahyeahyeahyeahyeahyeahyeahyeahyeahyeahyeahyeahyeahyeahyeahyeahyeahyeahyeahyeahyeahyeahyeahyeahyeahyeahyeahyeahyeahyeahyeahyeahyeahyeahyeahyeahyeahyeahyeahyeahyeahyeahyeahyeahyeahyeahyeahyeahyeahyeahyeahyeahyeahyeahyeahyeahyeahyeahyeahyeahyeahyeahyeahyeahyeahyeahyeahyeahyeahyeahyeahyeahyeahyeahyeahyeahyeahyeahyeahyeahyeahyeahyeahyeahyeahyeahyeahyeahyeahyeahyeahyeahyeahyeahyeahyeahyeahyeahyeahyeahyeahyeahyeahyeahyeahyeahyeahyeahyeahyeahyeahyeahyeahyeahyeahyeahyeahyeahyeahyeahyeahyeahyeahyeahyeahyeahyeahyeahyeahyeahyeahyeahyeahyeahyeahyeahyeahyeahyeahyeahyeahyeahyeahyeahyeahyeahyeahyeahyeahyeahyeahyeahyeahyeahyeahyeahyeahyeahyeahyeahyeahyeahyeahyeahyeahyeahyeahyeahyeahyeahyeahyeahyeahyeahyeahyeahyeahyeahyeahyeahyeahyeahyeahyeahyeahyeahyeahyeahyeahyeahyeahyeahyeahyeahyeahyeahyeahyeahyeahyeahyeahyeahyeahyeahyeahyeahyeahyeahyeahyeahyeahyeahyeahyeahyeahyeahyeahyeahyeahyeahyeahyeahyeahyeahyeahyeahyeahyeahyeahyeahyeahyeahyeahyeahyeahyeahyeahyeahyeahyeahyeahyeahyeahyeahyeahyeahyeahyeahyeahyeahyeahyeahyeahyeahyeahyeahyeahyeahyeahyeahyeahyeahyeahyeahyeahyeahyeahyeah"}},{"trigger":{"creator":"Ethan","triggerWord":"lover","isPhoto":false,"message":""}},{"trigger":{"creator":"Ethan","triggerWord":"liger","isPhoto":false,"message":"Like shit we live in a world where crazy shit happens all the time Kanye says slavery is a choice, Jared the subway guy touchs kids with his footlong, dinosaurs got wiped out by rocky boi, FREAKING LIGERS A CROSS BETWEEN LIONS AND MF TIGERS EXIST, and we're over here with people doubting the existence of some of the most mundane things that could happen in a person's life as if 7 billion people could not find a way to have plethora of unbelievable shit happen to them.
